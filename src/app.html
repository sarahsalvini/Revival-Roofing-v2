						"reviewBody": "Revival Roofing-Overland Park, KS deserves a MILLION STARS! This roofing company is not only the best overall company we have ever dealt with but they are literally the best at ALL TRADES! They have done two roofs for us, window replacement, all new gutters, interior and exterior paint! I am a price shopper AND super picky. I always get estimates. I quickly figured out I no longer needed to do that bc RR was so competitive with price AND the BEST quality. I truly feel like RR extended their contractor discount to us. Our realtor took note of RR's service and quality work and has since included Revival Roofing's business to her package that she gives to her clients. Malina Group with Keller Williams is one of the top sales groups in the country-so she definitely appreciated RR. RR stands WAY OUT-ABOVE ALL OF THE REST in not only ROOFING, but windows, painting, and so much more. The fact that the owner makes it a part of his day to personally take part in the process and over sees all jobs is extraordinary. The owners saw ALL of the projects from start to finish. He was incredibly helpful regarding insurance and even met with the adjusters for us! RR's crew are also the best in the business. They were excellent at their job and took pride in their work. They completed the job on time and were very clean and respectful of our home. The owners have been in the Roofing business for many years-going hard at it every day. They, like all of their employees take crazy pride in their projects. The owners and employees maintain a super close relationship with their different crews which is so important. The crews are all very loyal and this shows in their work. Revival Roofing did just that (Revival) to both of our houses! It was the best feeling to hand all of my ideas over to RR-and let them handle my REVIVAL! We recently moved to AZ-sure wish they would open up an RR here! KANSAS CITY IS A BETTER PLACE BC OF RR! In the meantime-they continue to bring EXCELLENCE IN ALL FIELDS to the Kansas City/Overland Park area. Phenomenal, perfection, extraordinary, dedication, responsive, perseverance, awesomeness, exceptional quality work, best customer care and service are only a few of the words that describe REVIVAL ROOFING! In a nut shell Revival Roofing checked all of our boxes! TOP Quality work, super competitive pricing and a one stop shop in handling all of our needs (roofing, gutters, painting and windows). I feel so blessed to have found this TRIED AND TRUE business! A MILLION STARS TO RR! Thank you for the great service!",

						"reviewBody": "We couldn't be happier with the work Revival Roofing did for us! They handled our new roof, new gutters, new paint, replaced our skylight and everything turned out amazing!! Working with Jake was more than I expected. I usually dread having work done on our house but he was excited, organized, and always on time. He made the process surprisingly fun (which isn't something I ever expected to say about home renovations!). The value was unbeatable. The quality of the work and attention to detail far exceeded what we expected for the price. They made sure we understood every step of the process, so we felt confident that we were getting exactly what we paid for. His crews were incredibly hard-working and finished everything much faster than we expected, all without sacrificing quality. It was clear they took pride in their work, and it showed in the final results and added so much value to our home! We're already planning to have Revival Roofing back to do our windows soon, and we'd recommend them to anyone looking for a local reliable and professional company to handle their home project! Thanks again, Jake and the team for making this such a great experience!!!",
